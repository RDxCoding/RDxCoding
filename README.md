Just a dusk-born coder chasing logic in the twilight.  
Python is my zone. AI is my path. Learning is the grind.  
Flirt in the day, code in the dusk — that’s how I roll.

Aspiring techie navigating the world of *Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning*.  
By day I’m about sports and smooth energy.  
By dusk, I grind through logic with discipline and vision.

I believe in learning with intention, growing with discipline, and coding with confidence.
